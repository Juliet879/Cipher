## Description
A Caesar cipher is a type of substitution in which each letter is shifted a certain number of places also known as a key, down the alphabet.  
## Behaviour Driven Development(BDD)

 Caesar cipher, both encoding, and decoding. The key is an integer from 1 to 25. This cipher rotates the letters of the alphabet (A to Z).
 The encoding replaces each letter with the 1st to 25th next letter in the alphabet (wrapping Z to A). So key 2 encrypts "HI" to "JK", 
 but key 20 encrypts "HI" to "BC".
